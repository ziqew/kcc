# cdo-authorized-keys

Installs the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file needed so that developers can access instances using SSH.

This file is generated from the node's `cdo-authorized-keys` element, a simple array of SSH public keys.

The default permisions list is defined in the `baseline` role that every instance should have applied.
