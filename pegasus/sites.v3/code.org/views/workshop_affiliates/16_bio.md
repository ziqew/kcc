Thinkersmith has led the charge for elementary school computer science for nearly half of a decade. As the creator of Code.org's Unplugged Code Studio lessons, they have been involved in the training of hundreds of educators and affiliates. Located in the Pacific Northwest, Thinkersmith has a global reach. Their programs and curriculum are used in schools with little to no technology, as well as schools that belong to the wealthiest districts in the nation. Their focus on appealing to girls and other non-traditional computer science populations helps them to keep training relevant to each teacher. Known for their hands-on, playful approach to computer science, Thinkersmith will have you out of your seat and teaching computer science before the day is out!
