**What teachers say about Joel's workshops**

"I came into Joel's workshop with NO experience in coding and was very apprehensive about learning anything about coding. After this workshop, I am so excited about going back to school and teaching coding to my kids!"

"Joel was a great presenter. He really knew what he was talking about. He answered questions without making anyone feel inadequate. Thank you for this opportunity!!!"
