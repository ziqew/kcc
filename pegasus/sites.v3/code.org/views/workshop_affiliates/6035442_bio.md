Kristen is ecstatic to be a part of Code.org’s K-5 outreach efforts. After teaching for three years she turned her eye towards the role of education technology and completed a certificate in E-Learning Design and Development. Never one to be out of the classroom for too long, she is a current graduate student in the University of Washington’s Master of Human-Computer Interaction and Design program. Kristen loves supporting teachers in their work to inspire students with the power of computer science education.
