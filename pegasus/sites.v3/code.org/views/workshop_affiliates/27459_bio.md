**What teachers say about Dave's workshops**

"The workshop was a wonderful personal and professional experience. I am more confident and prepared to teach the Code.org lessons to my students. I also have a better understanding of the broader goals of Code.org."

"I already have done the Advanced Course with students two years ago. I also started my Algebra Class in the CS in Algebra Course. Taking this workshop helped to clarify a lot of different questions that I had. I think it is a wonderful curriculum that I plan to try to incorporate into my teaching as much as I can. I will definitely use the Course 1 materials with the SDC kids that come to my after school coding club."

"Such an amazing opportunity! I cannot wait to share this with my students this week and the rest of the school year!"
