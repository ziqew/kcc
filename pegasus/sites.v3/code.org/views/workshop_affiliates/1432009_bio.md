Dennis Brylow is a computer science professor at Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. His research centers on building tools to help those who design, build, or teach complex computer systems, with a particular focus on embedded devices. He is a founding member of the Wisconsin-Dairyland chapter of the CSTA, and has been building PD workshops for K-12 teachers since 2005. He is the ringleader of the PUMP-CS Project, an NSF-funded effort to increase the number of qualified computer science

**What teachers say about Dennis's workshops**

"This was a positive, informative day! I enjoyed every minute of it and it
feels great to know that there is so much support for coding and computer
science." - Allyssa A. from Lake Geneva, WI

"The workshop challenged me to think about issues beyond my classroom. It
was the perfect workshop to get reenergized about teaching in general, but
computer science specifically." - Crystal P. from New Berlin, WI

"Wonderful day. Great materials. Dennis was an excellent facilitator."
