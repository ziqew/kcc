**What teacher say about Brian's workshops**

"I thought this was an excellent presentation. I enjoyed and came back to my building talking about it with my administrator and colleagues. I will be using this next week in my lesson plans. Thank you!"

"I am so impressed and feel very competent on how to teach my students how to Code. I am thinking about starting a group to teach girls, diverse students, and students with slight special needs how to Code and participate in STEM activities."
