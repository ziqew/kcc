Dianne O'Grady-Cunniff has been a computer science teacher for university, industry, teachers, high school, middle school and elementary students. Nothing could be more fun than to share the joy of the Code Studio with teachers and give them everything they need to share a well-rounded introduction to computer science with their own students.

**What teachers say about Dianne's workshops**

"Our whole county is doing computer science now, thank you for giving us such a great start!"

"I had to learn about the Code Studio for my students because the Hour of Code was the first thing that my son ever came back from school excited to show me what he did in school!"
