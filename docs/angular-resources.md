A few angular resources:

Getting started:
* Free codeschool course course: http://campus.codeschool.com/courses/shaping-up-with-angular-js/intro
* Developer Guide: https://code.angularjs.org/1.2.21/docs/guide
Note: we are using v1.2.21... when you eg. google for stuff and end up at the official docs, it will default to the 1.3beta version, so you should select 1.2.21 from the dropdown to make sure the docs are accurate for our version

Style guides (we haven't 'adopted' any of these)
* http://toddmotto.com/opinionated-angular-js-styleguide-for-teams/
* http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/angularjs-google-style.html

Debugging:
