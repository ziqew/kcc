# Variable assignment challenge

Ok, this one is kind of a big deal...

**If you can understand this problem, it puts you in the group of people who correlate highly with people who do well on the AP exam.**

That's right.  It turns out that people who do well in AP Computer Science have a proper *mental model* of what the computer is doing.  A paper written in 2008 demonstrated that a single programming question on the multiple choice section of the AP exam correlated highly with that student doing well or poorly on the exam overall.

The question below is similar to the question discovered for that paper. If you can understand the answer to this question it means that you have a good mental model for how computers work.  That understanding alone will carry you far.  So, here is the problem.

### What are the values of **a**, **b**, and **c** after the following lines of code have executed?

<pre>
var a = 3;
var b = 7;
var c = 10;
a = a+b;
b = a+b;
c = a+b;
</pre>


First, make a prediction.  Write it down.  Seriously, write it down.

Then continue on to the next page.  We've got this set up for you in code.  You will have to add your own **write** or **console.log** statements to verify the answer.
