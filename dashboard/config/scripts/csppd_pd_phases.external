## CSP PD Phases

These features described on the previous level run through each phase of the PD experience, which are described below: 

### Phase 1: Online Introduction
**Overview:** The first phase of professional development is a two-hour online introduction that focuses on providing a foundational knowledge of the Code.org program and CSP course resources. It creates a space for participants to become familiar with the curriculum, the platform, and the tools that will be used in the course.

### Phase 2: Blended Summer Study
**Overview:** The second phase of professional development is a blended in-person and follow-up online experience. 

* **In-person workshop:** This 5-day workshop is the primary opportunity for development prior to the first year of instruction. Participants will explore curriculum, tools, classroom management, and teaching strategies. You will dive into the College Board requirements that come with an AP course and build a local community of teachers who are using this curriculum. Spending practical time working with the curriculum, you will develop an understanding of how to effectively use the materials and pedagogical strategies that are part of any strong computer science classroom.

* **Online follow-up:** This 8-hour online experience provides space to plan the beginning of the academic year. Teachers will dive deeper into the curriculum, interacting with tools and widgets that students will use in the class. Additionally, the online work includes collaborating with other teachers in a professional online learning community— an important teacher tool during the first-year of teaching this course.

### Phase 3: Academic Year Development
**Overview:** The third phase of professional development is composed of blended ongoing quarterly in-person meetings and online activities.

* **In-person workshops:** These quarterly meetings will continue to build pedagogical strategies and explore the essential elements of this course. You will participate in activities such as using the AP performance tasks in your course, teaching new content, and keeping the classroom environment equitable and engaging for all students.
