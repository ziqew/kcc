“Being frustrated is a lot like being mad, but usually it means you’re mad because something is not the way you want it to be at the moment.”<br/><br/>

“You might think you’re mad at your teacher, or yourself, or your project.  You might even blame your anger on those scissors, or a piece of tape.  When you start to feel like you’re mad at everything and you just can’t take it anymore, that’s frustration.”
