# Variable Breakdown

## Common Mistake: Declaring a variable twice

In JavaScript you should just think of the word <span style="font-family: monospace">var</span> as shorthand for **“create a variable”.**  

Once you’ve created it, you don’t need to create it again. You can just refer to it by its name.

So, let’s say you wanted to create a variable called ‘foo’ with the value 7 and then later change it to 17.  This code is considered bad form...

<pre>
var foo = 7;
var foo = 17;
</pre>

The correct way to do this would be:

<pre>
var foo = 7;
foo = 17;
</pre>

I know, I know, it’s tempting to want to type <span style="font-family: monospace">var foo</span> the second time because you want to tell the computer, "Hey, I want to use the *variable foo*."    But you don’t have to. As we saw earlier, once the variable is made, you can just refer to it by its name.
