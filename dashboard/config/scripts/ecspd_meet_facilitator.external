I started in the suburbs teaching business and technology courses. I taught the Information Processing sequence at Von Steuben for nine years. The classes that I taught there consisted of ECS as well as Photoshop/Web Design. I am in my first year at Lane Tech College Prep where I teach ECS as well as Media Computation. I love how the Media Computation course integrates graphic design, animation, image manipulation, and song composition with coding.	</th><th class="gen">	I am really into crafts, DIY projects and making my own jewelry. I have been selling my jewelry for a few years now in boutique shops, home parties and online at Etsy.

I started creating my own curriculum but always wanted to do more with it. I came across the ECS curriculum online and liked a lot, but didn't have the class time to teach each lesson. When the pilot program came to NYC and my principal gave me 5 periods a week for the course I jumped at the opportunity.	</th></tr>
