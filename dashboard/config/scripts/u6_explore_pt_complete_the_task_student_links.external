For the Teacher: [AP Digital Portfolio: Teacher User Guide for AP Computer Science Principles](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/computer-science-principles-digital-portfolio-teacher-guide.pdf)

Students can find all the links they need on this page. (If you are viewing this from within the lesson plan click Student Overview to see the student view of the page).

Almost all of the links here are for **student reference, to use while completing the task.**

The only new document here is the "Guidelines for completing the task" which are mostly reminders about the requirements and how students are allowed to interact with each other and the teacher.
