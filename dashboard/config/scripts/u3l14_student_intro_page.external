## Unit 3: Lesson 14 - Unfortunate Events
# Background
By this point, you have a basic understanding of event-driven programming. This lesson focuses on common errors beginner programmers may encounter when dealing with events. 

Building up your "coding muscles" includes recognizing and correcting errors or bugs in your code and learning to spot and correct common errors.

There are also different kinds of errors.  Some break your program.  Others are tougher to spot: the code works but doesn't do what you expect!

# Lesson

* Follow a series of challenges presented in the "Unfortunate Events" worksheet.
* Solve and debug problems with buttons and event handlers
* Answer questions in the worksheet
