One topic that may hit home for your students is privacy over the internet. As an extended activity, you may want to use Snapchat as a case study. When the company first started, Snapchat had a bad reputation for its "disappearing" pictures that could actually be recovered.

As an extended exercise, you may want your students to investigate the parts of the app that caused these problems and how the company improved their reputation. Some key points may include:

<ul style="margin-left:350px">
  <li>"Deleted" images and files are not removed from a device until they are overwritten</li>
  <li>Snapchat enabled screenshots on a user's phone, so the sender and receiver knew it could still be accessed</li>
  <li>Snapchat released a disclaimer stating that the images are not actually deleted</li>
</ul>

<br/>

> Reflect: What are other ways you can use a case study or other strategy to reinforce the concepts of this lesson with your students?
