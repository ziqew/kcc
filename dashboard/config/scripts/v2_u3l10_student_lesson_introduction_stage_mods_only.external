# Unit 3: Lesson 10 - Practice PT - Design a Digital Scene

## Lesson

* Collaborate with a group to choose a topic for a digital scene
* Identify the major components of your digital scene and assign them to individual group members
* Individually program your assigned components of the digital scene
* Recombine your group's code and use it to create a digital scene
* Complete reflection questions

## Vocabulary

* **Abstraction** - a simplified representation of something more complex. Abstractions allow you to hide details to help you manage complexity, focus on relevant concepts, and reason about problems at a higher level.
