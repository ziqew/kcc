# Technology Foundations - What is a Computer?
In this lesson the class develops a preliminary definition of a computer. After brainstorming the possible definitions for a computer, the class works in groups to sort pictures into “is a computer” or “is not a computer” on poster paper and explain their motivations for choosing some of the most difficult categorizations. The teacher then introduces a definition of the computer and allows groups to revise their posters according to the new definition.
