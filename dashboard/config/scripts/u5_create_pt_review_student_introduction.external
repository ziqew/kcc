Students can find all the links they need for "tech stuff" on this page.  (If you are viewing this from within the lesson plan click **Student Overview** to see the student view of the page).

**Warning**: We **have included links** on this student page to the the scoring commentary for the sample tasks. If you you want students to try applying the scoring guidelines to tasks *without knowing ahead of time* you'll have to invoke some kind of honor system or strategy to have them hold off looking.
