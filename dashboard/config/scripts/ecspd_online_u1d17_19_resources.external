### Extended Resources

From Hal in the 2001 Space Odessy to the robots in the most recent Terminator movie, artificial intelligence has been cinematized by Hollywood for years. In some cases the robots are friendly and helpful. In others, they are malicious. Your students may come into your class with many pre-concieved notions of the positive and negative effects of smart computers.
