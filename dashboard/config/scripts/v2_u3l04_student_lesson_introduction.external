# Unit 3 - Lesson 4: Using Simple Commands

## Lesson
* Learn to use the App Lab programming environment
* Write a program that uses basic "building blocks" to draw an image in App Lab
* Think about what "efficiency" means when programming

## Vocab

The turtle hearkens back to early implementations in which children programmed a physical robot whose dome-like shape was reminiscent of a turtle.
