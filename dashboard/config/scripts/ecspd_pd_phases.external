## ECS PD Phases

These features described on the previous level run through each phase of the PD experience, which are described below: 

### Phase 1: Online introduction
**Overview:** The first phase of professional development is a two-hour online introduction that focuses on providing a foundational knowledge of the ECS course resources. It creates a space for participants to become familiar with the curriculum and the online PD platform.

### Phase 2: Blended summer study
**Overview:** The second phase of professional development is a blended in-person and follow-up online experience.

* **In-person workshop:** This 5-day workshop is the primary capacity building experience for teachers prior to their first year of instruction. Participants will explore curriculum, tools, classroom management, and teaching strategies. Spending practical time working with the curriculum, you will develop an understanding of how to effectively use the materials and pedagogical strategies that are part of any strong computer science classroom.

* **Online follow-up:** This 8-hour online experience provides space to plan the beginning of the
academic year. Teachers will dive deeper into the curriculum reflecting on lessons students
will be taught in the class. Additionally, this online piece introduces an opportunity to build a
collaborative professional online learning community — an important teacher tool during the
first-year of teaching this course.

### Phase 4: Summer wrap-up

phase addresses curricular materials with an eye for teaching and learning in context. Teachers
will reflect on what success looks like in an ECS course and how to recruit diverse groups of
students. The workshop will empower teachers to take ownership of the curriculum by making
adjustments and changes in order to meet the needs of each classroom.
