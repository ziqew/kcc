# Unit 3: Lesson 05 - Creating Functions

## Lesson

* Write functions with names that describe what each function does in solving the problem.
* Write a program that uses more than one function and more than one level of abstraction.

## Vocabulary

* **Abstraction:** a simplified representation of something more complex. Abstractions allow you to hide details to help you manage complexity, focus on relevant concepts, and reason about problems at a higher level.
* **Function:** a named group of programming instructions. Functions are reusable abstractions that reduce the complexity of writing and maintaining programs

## New Blocks

*  **[Define a function](//docs.code.org/applab/functionParams_none/)** - `function myFunction() {
    // function body
}`
*  **[Call a function](//docs.code.org/applab/callMyFunction/)** - `Call a function`

## Resources

* [College Board - Assessment Overview and Performance Task Directions for Students](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-csp-student-task-directions.pdf)

Either as a class or individually, students should watch a video introducing the way that functions are defined and called in JavaScript. You may wish to take a minute following the video to address any questions that may have developed from watching the video.
