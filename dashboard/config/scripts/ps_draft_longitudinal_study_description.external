# Participate in a longitudinal study!

## Are you 18 year or older?  
If you're 18 years or older, you can choose to participate in a longitudinal study with us - a long-range study that will try to capture the decisions, stories, and paths of students, *such as yoursef*, in your post-high school life.  

### If you want participate, [please fill out this simple form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScfLsr5G1HI1PFZOtShBnP6uIKG4c4N_HC_TUyKftzLKzk3-Q/viewform) so we can contact you after you graduate.

If you choose to participate, Code.org will contact you 2-3 times per year over the next few years. As a thank you, we will give you a &#36;10 gift card each time you participate.

## Not yet 18?
Unfortunately, you need to be at least 18 to participate in this study. You may contact us at csp@code.org once you turn 18, if you're interested in participating in the future.
