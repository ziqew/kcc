# Unit 3: Lesson 06 - Functions and Top-Down Design

## Lesson

* Learn about top-down design.
* Practice top-down design on a small problem.
* Program a solution to that problem.
* Revisit the 3x3 grid problem and consider using functions to solve it more efficiently.
  
## Vocabulary
* **Abstraction:** a simplified representation of something more complex. Abstractions allow you to hide details to help you manage complexity, focus on relevant concepts, and reason about problems at a higher level.
* **Function:** a named group of programming instructions. Functions are reusable abstractions that reduce the complexity of writing and maintaining programs
* **Top Down Design** - a problem solving approach (also known as stepwise design) in which you break down a system to gain insight into the sub-systems that make it up.

## Resources

* Top-Down Design - Worksheet ([PDF](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kfcdyJsC-I1Pl-TPWLv-BB7ffMxtw5B6XtegmVwzo7o/export?format=pdf) | [DOCX](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kfcdyJsC-I1Pl-TPWLv-BB7ffMxtw5B6XtegmVwzo7o/export?format=doc))
