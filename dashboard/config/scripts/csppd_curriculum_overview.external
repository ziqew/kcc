## CSP Curriculum Overview

Computer Science Principles (CSP) is a course designed around the [AP Computer Science Principles Framework] (http://secure-media.collegeboard.org/digitalServices/pdf/ap/ap-computer-science-principles-curriculum-framework.pdf). It becomes an official AP® course in the 2016-17 school year. Code.org’s CS Principles course is designed to be a full-year, rigorous, but entry-level course for high school students that covers the entire AP® framework and prepares them for success on the AP® exam. The curriculum is written to support teachers new to the discipline with inquiry-based activities, videos, assessment support, and computing tools that have built-in tutorials and student pacing guides. 

Explore the curriculum by clicking on the units below:

<details>
<summary><strong>Unit 1: The Digital Representation of Information</strong></summary>
This unit sets the foundations for thinking about the digital (binary) representation of information and how that affects the world we live in. This unit explores the technical challenges and questions that arise from the need to represent digital information in computers and transfer it between people and computational devices. Topics include: the digital representation of information - numbers, text, images, and communication protocols. The unit concludes with a practice Performance Task in which students invent their own file type/protocol for encoding a complex type of information that has some personal significance to them.

<details><summary><strong>Unit 2: The Internet</strong></summary>
In this unit students extend their understanding of the internet and how it functions by building off the concepts they learned when sending bits in Unit 1. The unit largely explores the structure and design of the internet and the implications of those design decisions including the reliability of network communication, the security of data, and personal privacy. Topics include the Internet Protocol (IP), DNS, TCP/IP, cryptography and other security and hacking concerns.

<details><summary><strong>Unit 3: Programming</strong></summary>
This unit introduces students to programming in the javascript language and creating small applications (apps) that live on the web. This introduction places a heavy emphasis on understanding the principles of computer programming and revealing those things that are universal to all computing and any programming language. Students will program in a new environment created by Code.org called App Lab that has many features, chief among them the ability to write javascript programs with click-and-drag blocks or just typing text - allowing the user to switch back and forth at will. This should greatly ease the transition to typing text-based programming languages. The unit concludes with a practice Performance Task in which students create a small app of their own to share with friends and family.

<details><summary><strong>Unit 4: Data</strong></summary>
In this unit students continue programming and building apps, but now with a heavier focus on data. Being able to extract knowledge from data is an important aspect of CS Principles and in this unit students will do that in a number of ways. Students will write programs that generate data to model or simulate a scenario they wish to investigate. Students will process large lists of data imported from other sources and also pull data from live data APIs. Students will also more fully use App Lab’s cloud data storage capabilities to create databases to use with their own apps.
</details>

<details><summary><strong>Unit 5: Performance Tasks</strong></summary>
This unit is set aside to ensure that students have enough time in class to work on and complete their performance tasks for submission to the College Board. There are guided activities for teachers to run that will help students get organized and ensure they have reasonable project plans that can be achieved in the time allotted.
