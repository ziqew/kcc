#### Response

Three years after this TED Talk was published, Facebook launched a new feature allowing users to manually prioritize their newsfeed. Starting in July 2015, users could choose which people appear at the top of their newsfeed and which people never appear in their newsfeed. Users were also given the option to "find new pages" to discover people and pages they might never have seen otherwise. Check out the full article below.
